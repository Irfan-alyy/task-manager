# Task Management System

## Overview

The Task Management System is a full-stack web application built with Next.js (using the App Router) that enables users to create, manage, and track their tasks efficiently. The application features user authentication, protected routes, and a robust task management system with functionalities like task creation, updating, deletion, and status tracking. It uses MongoDB for data storage, with the MongoDB driver for direct database connectivity and management.
Features

User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in securely. Authentication ensures that only logged-in users can access task-related functionalities.
### Task Management:
Create Tasks: Logged-in users can create tasks with details such as title, description, and status.
View Tasks: Users can view a list of their tasks.
Update Tasks: Users can edit task details and update statuses (e.g., Pending, Completed).
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks they no longer need.


Protected Routes: Task-related pages (e.g., task creation, task listing) are accessible only to authenticated users.
Multi-Page Application: Built with Next.js App Router for a seamless, multi-page user experience.
Responsive Design: The UI is user-friendly and responsive across various devices.

### Technologies Used

## Frontend:
Next.js (Latest version with App Router): For building the user interface, server-side rendering, static generation, and API routes.


## Backend:
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and task data.
MongoDB Driver: For direct database connectivity and management in Node.js.


Authentication: Custom authentication system (e.g., JWT or session-based, depending on implementation) to secure routes and manage user sessions.
Styling: CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, or other styling solutions (depending on your implementation).
Deployment: (Optional: Add deployment platform if applicable, e.g., Vercel).

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)
MongoDB (local or cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)
Git
A package manager like npm or yarn

### Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-management-system


Install Dependencies:
npm install
